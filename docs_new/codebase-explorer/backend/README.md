# Backend Expedition: Unveiling the Intelligence Core

Embark on an expedition into the backend systems of CogniCode Agent! This is where the heavy lifting happens: AI models are orchestrated, code is analyzed, and insights are generated. Our backend is a Python application built with Flask, designed for efficient processing and real-time communication via WebSockets.

## Guiding Principles for the Backend

*   **Accuracy:** Provide reliable and precise code analysis.
*   **Performance:** Process code and run AI models efficiently to enable real-time feedback.
*   **Privacy:** Ensure all code processing and AI inference occur locally, with no data leaving the user's machine.
*   **Modularity:** Design agents and services that are distinct and can be independently updated or extended.
*   **Resourcefulness:** Manage system resources (CPU, memory) carefully, especially when dealing with potentially large AI models.

## Key Areas We'll Explore:

1.  **`server/app.py`:** The main entry point and orchestrator of the Flask backend. It handles incoming WebSocket connections, HTTP requests, and coordinates the agents.
    *   [The Heartbeat: `server/app.py`](app_py.md)
2.  **`server/agents/` Directory:** This is where our specialized AI agents reside. Each agent is responsible for a specific type of analysis (linting, refactoring, test generation). We'll explore the base agent structure and individual agent implementations.
    *   [The Brains: `server/agents/`](agents_directory.md)
3.  **`server/services/` Directory:** Contains modules like `code_service.py` that provide business logic, such as processing agent results, caching, and other core functionalities.
    *   [Core Services: `server/services/`](services_directory.md)
4.  **`server/utils/` Directory:** Home to utility modules, for instance, `logger.py` for robust logging throughout the backend.
    *   [Backend Utilities: `server/utils/`](utils_directory.md)
5.  **AI Model Management:** While not a specific directory for code, we'll discuss how AI models are loaded, managed, and utilized by the agents.

Join us as we navigate the intricate workings of the CogniCode Agent backend. Each link above will guide you to a more detailed examination of that component.
