# CogniCode Agent - Quick Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket Connection Errors
**Issue**: `Socket error: Connection failed`
**Fixed by**:
- Improved connection handling with proper delays
- Better error handling and retry logic
- Enhanced initialization sequence

### 2. React Rendering Error
**Issue**: `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {progress, message})`
**Fixed by**:
- Proper handling of progress objects in the frontend
- Safe extraction of progress and message properties
- Added fallback values for undefined properties

### 3. Server WSGI Error
**Issue**: `AssertionError: write() before start_response`
**Fixed by**:
- Improved error handling in Flask-SocketIO handlers
- Better session management
- Enhanced exception handling with proper logging

## How to Run

### Option 1: Use the Startup Script (Recommended)
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd server
python app.py

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend (wait for backend to be ready)
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see connection errors:
1. Wait 5-10 seconds after starting the backend before opening the frontend
2. Check that the backend is running on http://localhost:8000/health
3. Ensure no other services are using ports 3000 or 8000

### If the analysis button shows errors on first click:
1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Verify the backend logs for any initialization issues

### Backend Dependencies
Make sure you have all Python dependencies installed:
```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Socket Connection**: Added proper delays, retry logic, and better error handling
2. **React Component Safety**: Added null checks and fallback values for all data properties
3. **Server Stability**: Improved Flask-SocketIO error handling and session management
4. **Startup Script**: Automated proper initialization sequence
5. **Health Checks**: Enhanced backend health endpoint for better debugging

The application should now start reliably and handle errors gracefully without the previously reported issues.
