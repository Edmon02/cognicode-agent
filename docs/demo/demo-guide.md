### **üé≠ SCRIPT TO FOLLOW:**

#### **[0:00-0:15] Opening Hook**
**What to say:**
> "Hi! I'm excited to show you CogniCode Agent - an AI-powered development tool that revolutionizes how we write, analyze, and improve code. Let me show you how it works."

**What to show:**
- Clean interface with fibonacci example loaded
- Professional, modern UI

---

#### **[0:15-0:30] Problem Setup**
**What to say:**

- Highlight the recursive fibonacci function
- Show the processUserData function with various issues

---

#### **[0:30-1:15] Analysis Demo**
**What to say:**
> "Let's analyze this code. I'll click Analyze and watch as our AI agents examine the code in real-time."

*[Click Analyze button]*

> "Amazing! Look at this - it found performance issues with the recursive fibonacci function, identified code style problems, and even calculated a quality score. The AI detected that our recursive approach is inefficient and found several other improvements."

**What to show:**
