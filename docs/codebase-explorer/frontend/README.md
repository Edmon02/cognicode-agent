# Frontend Journey: Exploring the User Interface

Welcome to the frontend section of our Codebase Explorer! Here, we'll navigate through the React and Next.js code that powers the user interface of CogniCode Agent. This is where the user interacts with the application, inputs their code, and sees the insightful results from our AI agents.

Our frontend is built with modern web technologies, focusing on a responsive design, real-time updates, and a smooth user experience.

## Guiding Principles for the Frontend

*   **Interactivity:** Provide immediate feedback and a dynamic experience.
*   **Clarity:** Present complex analysis results in an understandable way.
*   **Performance:** Ensure the UI remains snappy and responsive, even with ongoing backend communication.
*   **Modularity:** Build with reusable components and maintainable code.

## Key Areas We'll Explore:

1.  **The `app/` Directory:** The heart of our Next.js App Router setup. We'll look at root layouts, main page structure, and how routing is handled.
    *   [Delving into `app/layout.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`](./app_directory.md)
2.  **The `components/` Directory:** Home to our reusable React components, from simple UI elements (`shadcn/ui`) to complex, application-specific ones like the `CodeEditor` and results panels.
    *   [Dissecting Core Components (`CodeEditor`, `AnalysisPanel`, etc.)](./components_directory.md)
3.  **The `hooks/` Directory:** Where custom React Hooks live. The `use-socket` hook, responsible for WebSocket communication, is a star player here.
    *   [Understanding Custom Hooks (especially `use-socket`)](./hooks_directory.md)
4.  **The `lib/` Directory:** Utility functions and helpers that support our frontend logic.
    *   [Exploring Frontend Utilities](./lib_directory.md)

Let's begin our journey through the frontend codebase! Each link above will take you to a more detailed exploration of that specific area.
